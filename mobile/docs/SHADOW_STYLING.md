# Shadow Styling Implementation

## Current Implementation

The project uses a cross-platform shadow styling solution that works across both web and native platforms. The implementation is located in `src/utils/styles.ts` and provides a consistent API for adding shadows to components.

```typescript
// Example usage in components
import { createShadowStyle } from '../../utils/styles';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    ...createShadowStyle(2),
    // other styles
  }
});
```

## Development Warnings

When running the web version in development mode, you may see the following warning:

```
"shadow*" style props are deprecated. Use "boxShadow".
```

This warning comes from react-native-web's internal implementation and is expected in development. Important notes about this warning:

1. It's a development-only warning and does not appear in production builds
2. It doesn't affect the functionality or appearance of the application
3. It's related to react-native-web's internal handling of shadow styles

## Why We Keep This Implementation

Despite the development warning, the current implementation offers several benefits:

1. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: The same code works across web and native platforms
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all shadow properties
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized shadow styling logic in a single utility
4. **Platform-Specific Optimization**: Automatically uses the best shadow implementation for each platform

## Alternative Approaches Considered

We explored several approaches to handle shadow styling:

1. **Webpack Warning Suppression**: Attempted to suppress specific warnings through webpack configuration
2. **Console Warning Filtering**: Implemented a warning suppression utility
3. **CSS-only Approach**: Tried using pure CSS solutions for web
4. **Platform-Specific Implementations**: Tested separate implementations for web and native

Each approach had trade-offs, and the current implementation provides the best balance of functionality, maintainability, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Future Considerations

1. Monitor react-native-web updates for changes in shadow styling implementation
2. Consider platform-specific styling if shadow requirements become more complex
3. Evaluate impact of shadow styling on performance in larger components
